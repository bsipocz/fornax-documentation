## What is the NASA Astrophysics Science Platform?

Increased compute, increased reproducibility, increased inclusion, software installs done for users

* What does it do? (Basic Capabilities)
* Who is it for?
* Limits: What does it not do?
  * How much compute do I get?
  * [Limits](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/sciserver/#limits) on diskspace, lifetime of containers etc.
  * [Download](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/sciserver/#limits) restrictions to prevent egress charges

## Getting started
* How do I get an account?
* How to Log in?
  * Log in at  https://daskhub.fornaxdev.mysmce.com/
* How to log out?
  *  go to `File` Menu: `hub control panel` and `stop my server`.  This insures the server is not still running when you logout which would be a waste of resources
  *  then logout in the upper right
* How to choose which server to open upon login
  * This depends on which type of science you want to do. Placeholder to fill this in once server names stabilize.
* How to choose which size server to open upon login?
  * Make sure to use `mini` size for writing/debugging/testing before switching to larger sizes
  * On demand means an AWS server that starts when the user asks for it (e.g., start your Fornax server), runs as long as you continue to use and pay for it.
  * 128 core: do not use unless given permission
* Navigating jupyter lab
  * How do I start a new notebook?
    * The blue `+` in the upper left brings you to the launcher where you can start a new, empty notebook or open a terminal window
  * How do I get a terminal window?
    * The blue `+` in the upper left brings you to the launcher where you can start a new notebook or open a terminal window
  * How to upload data into the platform?
    * The uparrow in the upper left allows you to upload data
    * if it is a large amount of data, consider creating a zip or tar archive first
    * You can also from within your Jupyter Lab use the shell to 'scp' or 'git pull' from external sites that are publicly visible.
    * What are our storage limits for uploaded data?
    * How will I know if I run into a storage limit?
  *  How to download data from the plaltform to my local machine?
     * If it is a small file, you can right click on the file name in the file browser and scroll to `Download`
     * if it is a large amount of data, consider creating a zip or tar archive first
  * Home Directory
    * When you log into the science console, the active directory is your $HOME directory.  This directory is unique to you: edits and uploads are not visible to other users.  
  * Does my work persist between sessions?
    * Files in your home directory will persist between sessions.
    * pip installs will persist across kernel restarts, but not across logging out and back in.
      * If you want software installs to be persistent, consider setting up an environment: See below under "Making a conda environment that persists across sessions"
* How to share files from inside the SP with collaborators
  * Download them to favorite storage place (university box account) or put in cloud (put $$ in your proposals to cover this)
* How do I know what computing resources are available to me?
* How do I save my notebook as a python script?
* Save your work!
   * the platform will cull servers after a user is inactive for a certain amount of time - what is that time limit??
* How do I run a notebook non-interactively?
* How to open a plot (png, pdf, etc.) either generated by a notebook or uploaded ?
  * double clicking on them in the file browser will open them in a new tab
* Will notebooks that I run on the SP also work on my laptop?
  * To run the demo notebooks on your laptop, you will also need to have the container that we use which includes software used by the notebooks.
    * see below under "Can I run the container from the SP on my own personal computer/laptop?"
* Do I need to worry about costs when working in the SP?
  * NASA will pay for the work that you do, but please be mindful of those costs.
* How do I know what costs I am incurring?

## Data Access
* How do I add my own data?
 * small files can be added with the upload button, which is an `uparrow` in the upper right
 * large file transfers??
* Where should I store my data in the SP? 
* How to access data in the cloud?
  * [STScI](https://github.com/spacetelescope/tike_content/blob/main/content/notebooks/data-access/data-access.ipynb) tutorial
  * Can I see that directly in the terminal?
* Use astroquery or pyvo etc.,- links to various tutorials here
  * [Data discovery with HEASARC tools](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/sciserver/#data-discovery)

## Managing Software
* Making a conda environment that persists across sessions([JupyterLab Kernels](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/MASTDOCS/Managing+Software#ManagingSoftware-JupyterLabKernels))
* [Pre-installed Software](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/MASTDOCS/Managing+Software#ManagingSoftware-Pre-installedSoftwareandTemporaryAdditions): can I get a list of what is already there?
* How do I install my own software?
  * [Persistent User-Installed Software](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/MASTDOCS/Managing+Software#ManagingSoftware-PersistentUser-InstalledSoftware)
  * Non-persistent User-Installed Software 
    * you can !pip install your favorite software from inside a notebook.  This installed software will stay through kernel restarts, but will not be persistent if you stop your server and restart it (logging out and back in). 
  * [From a Notebook cell:](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/MASTDOCS/Managing+Software#ManagingSoftware-FromaNotebookcell:)
  * [From a terminal window:](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/MASTDOCS/Managing+Software#ManagingSoftware-Fromaterminalwindow:)
* Terminal command to list package version info using pip
* Can I launch apps from icons? Like MOPEX or SPICE
* Can I run licensed software (IDL) in the SP?
* Can I bring my own docker image?
* Can I run the container from the SP on my own personal computer/laptop?

## Troubleshooting
* If users internet connection goes away - what happens to the running notebook?
* Restart kernel
* Restart SP - will solve version issues if packages with different versions were loaded since these won’t persist across SP restarts

## Getting Help
* We need to setup a helpdesk!!
